It allows users of various technical abilities to perform actions on large, unmanageable amounts of complex data—such as appling filters and creating visualizations —to distill that data into meaningful information.

                        One of Contour’s main value propositions is that it enables users to perform these actions without knowledge of formula syntax, and it creates a visual representation, called a <i>path</i>, of how the data changed from its original source. This feature allows users to easily collaborate with one another, making it a powerful analytical and presentation tool.

                        While Contour is constantly evolving to solve new user needs, it had reached a point where the application became so unwiedly that users were unable to locate or take advantage of many features. Through conducting internal audits, interviewing product stakeholders, and shadowing users in the field, our team identified Contour’s overall UX as a high priority problem.

These cards help emphasize that players need to do more than save money, they need to invest to help them cover unforseen costs.
