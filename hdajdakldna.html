                    Contour is a top-down data analysis application within the <a href="https://www.palantir.com/palantir-foundry/" target="_blank">Foundry platform</a>. It allows users of various technical abilities to perform actions on large, unmanageable amounts of complex data—such as appling filters and creating visualizations—to distill that data into meaningful information.

                <p class="copy">
                    One of Contour’s main value propositions is that it enables users to perform these actions without knowledge of formula syntax, and it creates a visual representation, called a <i>path</i>, of how the data changed from its original source. This feature allows a range of users to easily collaborate with one another, making it a powerful analytical and presentation tool.

Through conducting internal audits, interviewing product stakeholders, and shadowing users in the field, our team identified Contour’s overall UX as a high priority problem.

                        After consolidating the research findings and identifying how different user groups are affected by the UX problems, it was clear that improving the toolbar experience could significantly enhance usability of the application as a whole. I started exploring some low-fidelity design ideas that aimed to solve each pain point we had identified across Contour.

                    <p class="copy">
                        During this process I lead my team through a series of design exercises like “Crazy 8s” which we used to collaboratively identify requirements based on existing workflows and user types. Once we felt confident in our understanding of the user needs and had some loose ideas on how to solve them, I moved into creating a series of wireframes which we used to validate and refine our ideas.

                        One recurring issue with discovery that we aimed to solve was that features were not grouped in a meaningful way.  This prevented users from being able to quicly find what they were looking for, and we hypothesized that categories would improve action discoverability and help users understand what they do.

                        After exploring and internally testing different ways of grouping actions—for example usage numbers, action type, alphabetic—I decided to group the boards into categories based on their functionality. This option proved to be the most intuitive and customizable; it could accommodate an arbitrary number of custom boards and allow users to quickly see all actions with related functionality at once.

                            To validate our assumptions, I developed two versions (seen above) as prototypes in Principle and tested with real users on-site. Since the two concepts were drastically different, I felt it was important to understand the pros and cons of each one. In Version 1, the Toolbar is replaced with a side column and a drag-and-drop style interaction. Version 2 followed the established pattern with the Toolbar, but included action categories and contextual illustrations.

                            During testing sessions, I had multiple users run through various scenarios with each prototype. I recorded quotes, verbal feedback, and notes documenting how easily users were able to accomplish given tasks. These notes helped me understand the pros and cons of each concept and heavily influenced the final design.

                            From the testing session I learned that Version 1’s sidebar interaction was too different from the existing pattern, and drag-and-drop method of applying new actions was also confusing. However, I also found that users responded positively to the new categories and descriptions from both Versions 1 and 2. While neither prototype provided the solution we were looking for, they both introduced several features that users responded well to. After compiling and evaluating the results of the testing sessions I was able to incorporate the positive improvements from both prototypes into the final design.

                        After shipping the new toolbar, our team kept a close eye on incoming metrics and followed up with users and analysts in the field to see how it was being received. We found that our UX improvements had a number of positive impacts including reducing required training sessions, an increase in the types of boards being used, and a huge increase in the number of board inserts, implying that users now had a much better understanding of how to use Contour.

                        Redesigning Contour’s toolbar was a challenging effort due to the sheer number of user variables and workflows we needed to accommodate. At the end of the day I believe we found success by keeping an open mind and collaborating with users throughout the process. By working closely with our clients and continuously iterating on our hypotheses, we were able to develop a solution that was practical, efficient, and universally accessible.
