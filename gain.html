                        Investing is one of the best ways to build long-term wealth, but a lot of people miss out on this experience because they believe that it's only for affluent people and don’t realize the breadth of options available to them.

                        We were approached by PNC to design an experience that would encourage customers to share personal information with the institution in order to receive personalized banking advice. We began our process using personas and preliminary research that the client had done in order to better define the problem space. From there we set out to synthesize and validate their findings, and conduct our own research to fill in the gaps.

The board game would act as an introduction to investment strategies, and the app would provide the customer with opportunities to use what they learned during gameplay.

                                        While users are moving their pieces around the board they will also encounter Chance cards and Needs cards, which can provide surprise income from events like inheritance or winning a local lottery, or induce unexepected costs like parking tickets and surgeries. These cards help emphasize that players need to do more than save money, they need to invest to help them cover unforseen costs.
